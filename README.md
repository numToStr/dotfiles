> NOTE: After the installation, when you'll open your terminal, or a different tab then `zinit` will start downloading some command line tools that are used inside the dotfiles.

## ‚ú® Commands

For convenience, I've added some `make` commands to do some regular stuff which are following:

-   `setup` - For setting up the dotfiles on a new machine

-   `install` - To reinstall the dotfiles, it doesn't include the setup part

-   `update` - For updating the dotfiles, which will pull the latest commits and install them

-   `purge` - Removes everything
